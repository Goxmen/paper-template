# latex-paper

LaTeX style file for academic papers

## How to use

- Add `paper.sty` to the folder with your LaTeX files
- Insert `\usepackage{paper}` in the preamble of your document

## Example

The paper `paper.pdf` was produced with the style file. The LaTeX file `paper.tex` illustrates how to use the new commands defined in the style file. The new mathematical commands are defined in `math.sty`, which is [available in this GitHub repository](https://github.com/pmichaillat/latex-math).
