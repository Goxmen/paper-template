# latex-paper

LaTeX style file to format academic papers

## How to use

- Add `paper.sty` to the folder with your LaTeX files
- Insert `\usepackage{paper}` in the preamble of your document

## Key features

- Text font is Source Serif Pro
- Greek & symbol font is Euler 
- No colors are used in the test so papers print well
- Margins & spacing are set for comfortable reading

## Example

The paper `paper.pdf` was produced with the style file. The LaTeX file `paper.tex` illustrates how to use the new commands defined in the style file. The new mathematical commands are defined in `math.sty`, which is [available in this GitHub repository](https://github.com/pmichaillat/latex-math).

## Reference

As much as possible the style file follows Matthew Butterick's wonderful typographical advice in [Practical Typography](https://practicaltypography.com).
